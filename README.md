# Learning Puppet

This Git repository contains the code, configuration files, and
documentation I created while learning Puppet, a widely used
configuration management tool.
The repository includes examples and exercises, such as Puppet
manifests, modules, and other resources I created while exploring
the different features and functionalities of Puppet.


### Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to document my Puppet learning
journey and provide a helpful resource for anyone looking to
learn Puppet.
